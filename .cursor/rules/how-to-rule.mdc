# How to Use Tech AI Assistant Rules in Cursor AI

To use any of the rules below, simply mention the rule name in your Cursor AI chat using the '@' symbol. For example: "@architecture-definition-rule create a definition for..."

## Shared References
The following reference materials are available to all rules:
- **Architecture Reference**: Located at `reference/Architecture`
- **Product Reference**: Located at `reference/Product`
- **Operations Reference**: Located at `reference/Operations`
  - Contains operational, platform, and process documentation
  - Used for platform documentation, operational runbooks, and related rules

## Required Information
Each rule requires specific minimum information to generate accurate and useful output. The AI will prompt you for this information before proceeding.
